# Godot Documentation Downloader

This script downloads the Godot documentation zip file and extracts it to a specified directory. It also installs `doc2dash` using `pipx` and uses `doc2dash` to create a Dash docset file. Finally, it generates a Dash docset XML feed that can be used to add the docset to Dash.
